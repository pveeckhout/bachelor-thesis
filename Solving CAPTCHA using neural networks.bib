@phdthesis{Beede2010,
abstract = {This report provides an analysis of the effectiveness of the reCAPTCHA system and the methods used to defeat it. CAPTCHA stands for “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart” and is used in real-world applications as a mechanism for distinguishing whether input is coming from a human or a computer. Its primary purpose is to help prevent, or at least reduce, the amount of SPAM or unsolicited messages in e-mail, online message forums, and online polls (Strickland) by verifying that an actual human is making the submission versus an automated computer. Many spammers (unsolicited message senders) use bots (automated computer software) to send their messages to as many people as possible. By using a CAPTCHA a web site owner hopes to reduce these messages by making the use of bots impossible and requiring the spammer to do many hours of manual entry to get a message through. The system, however, must still allow for actual humans to be able to access the system in an easy way. A CAPTCHA works by requiring the user to answer a CAPTCHA challenge by typing in some combination of letters, numbers, or words that are displayed in an image. This image, however, is distorted by computer vision algorithms that add random noise to it. Some examples of the types of noise generated are bending the characters, inserting lines through the characters, generating random colored dots in the background, and adding spurious characters such as shadows behind other characters. The end goal is to prevent a computer using OCR algorithms from being able to read the challenge while a human could.},

@article{Burges1998,
abstract = {The tutorial starts with an overview of the concepts of VC dimension and structural risk minimization. We then describe linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for separable and non-separable data, working through a non-trivial example in detail. We describe a mechanical analogy, and discuss when SVM solutions are unique and when they are global. We describe how support vector training can be practically implemented, and discuss in detail the kernel mapping technique which is used to construct SVM solutions which are nonlinear in the data. We show how Support Vector machines can have very large (even infinite) VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for homogeneous polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While very high VC dimension would normally bode ill for generalization performance, and while at present there exists no theory which shows that good generalization performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are several arguments which support the observed high accuracy of SVMs, which we review. Results of some experiments which were inspired by these arguments are also presented. We give numerous examples and proofs of most of the key theorems. There is new material, and I hope that the reader will find that even old material is cast in a fresh light.},

abstract = {This document explains how to use Barber's Deterministic Latent Tables [1] \& [2] to learn the parameters in a Hop eld Network. The document con- cludes with Matlab code showing an implementation of the learning method detailed here. In order to make the maths appear less cluttered, superscript indices such as the t in vt relate to time. Vectors are represented by bold font, and an element in a vector or array by subscript indices, so vti is the ith element of vector v at time t. With the aim of making the resultant Matlab implementation as transparent as possible, where horizontal space permits, some of the equations that are outlined are shown in both matrix form (A) and element by element form (Aij ).},

The network obtained using this approach e6ectively inherits the knowledge from the local training procedure before improving on its generalization ability through the subsequent global training.

@techreport{Mori2003,
abstract = {In this paper we explore object recognition in clutter. We test our object recognition techniques on Gimpy and EZGimpy, examples of visual CAPTCHAs. A CAPTCHA (“Completely Automated Public Turing test to Tell Computers and HumansApart”) is a program that can generate andgrade tests thatmost humans can pass, yet current computer programs can’t pass. EZ-Gimpy (see Fig. 1, 5), currently used by Yahoo, and Gimpy (Fig. 2,9) are CAPTCHAs based on word recognition in the presence of clutter. These CAPTCHAs provide excellent test sets since the clutter they contain is adversarial; it is designed to confuse computer programs. We have developed efﬁcient methods based on shape context matching that can identify the word in anEZGimpy image with a success rate of 92\%, and the requisite 3 words in a Gimpy image 33\% of the time. The problem of identifying words in such severe clutter provides valuable insight into the more general problem of object recognition in scenes. The methods that we present are instances of a framework designed to tackle this general problem.},

@unpublished{Motoyama2010,
abstract = {Reverse Turing tests, or CAPTCHAs, have become an ubiquitous defense used to protect open Web resources from being exploited at scale. An effective CAPTCHA resists existing mechanistic software solving, yet can be solved with high probability by a human being. In response, a robust solving ecosystem has emerged, reselling both automated solving technology and realtime human labor to bypass these protections. Thus, CAPTCHAs can increasingly be understood and evaluated in purely economic terms; the market price of a solution vs the monetizable value of the asset being protected.We examine the market-side of this question in depth, analyzing the behavior and dynamics of CAPTCHA-solving service providers, their price performance, and the underlying labor markets driving this economy.},
