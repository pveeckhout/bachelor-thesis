abstract = {In this paper, I develop an economic argument for regulating the sending of junk emails, and examine the efficiency of various approaches to regulate junk emails. The first part of the paper develops an externality model of spam to show that in the absence of regulation, junk emails are inefficient. Next, I analyse the regulatory approaches presently used in the United States in three categories: opt-out, filtering and blocking, and opt-in. The study finds that spam can be both a positive externality as well as a negative o­ne. However, the likelihood of being a negative externality is more probable. Absence regulation, no allocation of a property right to spam leads to an efficient level of spam. An examination of the three categories show that o­nly the opt-in approach ensures that there is no net social loss, but not necessarily at a socially efficient level of spam. Hence, it is o­nly a second best solution. Based o­n the conclusions that opt-in is the best solution given the constraints of transaction cost, the paper suggests a set of policy conclusions that serve as guidelines for countries enacting laws to regulate junk emails or spam.},

An effective CAPTCHA resists existing mechanistic software solving, yet can be solved with high probability by a human being. In response, a robust solving ecosystem has emerged, reselling both automated solving technology and realtime human labor to bypass these protections. Thus, CAPTCHAs can increasingly be understood and evaluated in purely economic terms; the market price of a solution vs the monetizable value of the asset being protected.We examine the market-side of this question in depth, analyzing the behavior and dynamics of CAPTCHA-solving service providers, their price performance, and the underlying labor markets driving this economy.},

abstract = {Atomizing various Web activities by replacing human to human interactions on the Internet has been made indispensable due to its enormous growth. However, bots also known as Web-bots which have a malicious intend and pretending to be humans pose a severe threat to various services on the Internet that implicitly assume a human interaction. Accordingly, Web service providers before allowing access to such services use various Human Interaction Proof’s (HIPs) to authenticate that the user is a human and not a bot. Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA) is a class of HIPs tests and are based on Artificial Intelligence. These tests are easier for humans to qualify and tough for bots to simulate. Several Web services use CAPTCHAs as a defensive mechanism against automated Web-bots. In this paper, we review the existing CAPTCHA schemes that have been proposed or are being used to protect various Web services. We classify them in groups and compare them with each other in terms of security and usability. We present general method used to generate and break text-based and image-based CAPTCHAs. Further, we discuss various security and usability issues in CAPTCHA design and provide guidelines for improving their robustness and usability.},

@phdthesis{Beede2010,
abstract = {This report provides an analysis of the effectiveness of the reCAPTCHA system and the methods used to defeat it. CAPTCHA stands for “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart” and is used in real-world applications as a mechanism for distinguishing whether input is coming from a human or a computer. Its primary purpose is to help prevent, or at least reduce, the amount of SPAM or unsolicited messages in e-mail, online message forums, and online polls (Strickland) by verifying that an actual human is making the submission versus an automated computer. Many spammers (unsolicited message senders) use bots (automated computer software) to send their messages to as many people as possible. By using a CAPTCHA a web site owner hopes to reduce these messages by making the use of bots impossible and requiring the spammer to do many hours of manual entry to get a message through. The system, however, must still allow for actual humans to be able to access the system in an easy way. A CAPTCHA works by requiring the user to answer a CAPTCHA challenge by typing in some combination of letters, numbers, or words that are displayed in an image. This image, however, is distorted by computer vision algorithms that add random noise to it. Some examples of the types of noise generated are bending the characters, inserting lines through the characters, generating random colored dots in the background, and adding spurious characters such as shadows behind other characters. The end goal is to prevent a computer using OCR algorithms from being able to read the challenge while a human could.},

A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices.},

@book{Hebb1949,

However, the original edition has been unavailable since 1966, ensuring that Hebb's comment that a classic normally means "cited but not read" is true in his case. This new edition rectifies a long-standing problem for behavioral neuroscientists-the inability to obtain one of the most cited publications in the field. The Organization of Behavior played a significant part in stimulating the investigation of the neural foundations of behavior and continues to be inspiring because it provides a general framework for relating behavior to synaptic organization through the dynamics of neural networks. D.O. Hebb was also the first to examine the mechanisms by which environment and experience can influence brain structure and function, and his ideas formed the basis for work on enriched environments as stimulants for behavioral development. References to Hebb, the Hebbian cell assembly, the Hebb synapse, and the Hebb rule increase each year. These forceful ideas of 1949 are now applied in engineering, robotics, and computer science, as well as neurophysiology, neuroscience, and psychology-a tribute to Hebb's foresight in developing a foundational neuropsychological theory of the organization of behavior.},

To evaluate the proposed method, we applied it to the traveling salesman problem (TSP), and examined two indexes: the tour length of the solution and the number of kinks in the solution. Consequently, the two indexes are lower for the proposed method. These results indicate that our proposed method has the ability to reduce topological defects.},
