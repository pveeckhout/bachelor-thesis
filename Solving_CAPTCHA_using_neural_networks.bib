@article{Khong2004,
abstract = {In this paper, I develop an economic argument for regulating the sending of junk emails, and examine the efficiency of various approaches to regulate junk emails. The first part of the paper develops an externality model of spam to show that in the absence of regulation, junk emails are inefficient. Next, I analyse the regulatory approaches presently used in the United States in three categories: opt-out, filtering and blocking, and opt-in. The study finds that spam can be both a positive externality as well as a negative o­ne. However, the likelihood of being a negative externality is more probable. Absence regulation, no allocation of a property right to spam leads to an efficient level of spam. An examination of the three categories show that o­nly the opt-in approach ensures that there is no net social loss, but not necessarily at a socially efficient level of spam. Hence, it is o­nly a second best solution. Based o­n the conclusions that opt-in is the best solution given the constraints of transaction cost, the paper suggests a set of policy conclusions that serve as guidelines for countries enacting laws to regulate junk emails or spam.},

abstract = {CAPTCHAs are commonly used security measures on the internet that prevent automated programs from abusing online services. They do so by asking humans to perform a task that computers cannot yet perform, such as recognizing shapes, deciphering distorted characters, discerning objects or animals in images or solving puzzles. CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart. As we will see, many attacks have been attempted to break or beat CAPTCHAS with some success. We will look at these unique, creative and even resourceful attempts and subsequent countermeasures and propose a new system of our own, building on some recent successes},

@phdthesis{Motoyama2010,
abstract = {Reverse Turing tests, or CAPTCHAs, have become an ubiquitous defense used to protect open Web resources from being exploited at scale. An effective CAPTCHA resists existing mechanistic software solving, yet can be solved with high probability by a human being. In response, a robust solving ecosystem has emerged, reselling both automated solving technology and realtime human labor to bypass these protections. Thus, CAPTCHAs can increasingly be understood and evaluated in purely economic terms; the market price of a solution vs the monetizable value of the asset being protected.We examine the market-side of this question in depth, analyzing the behavior and dynamics of CAPTCHA-solving service providers, their price performance, and the underlying labor markets driving this economy.},

@article{Banday2011,
abstract = {Atomizing various Web activities by replacing human to human interactions on the Internet has been made indispensable due to its enormous growth. However, bots also known as Web-bots which have a malicious intend and pretending to be humans pose a severe threat to various services on the Internet that implicitly assume a human interaction. Accordingly, Web service providers before allowing access to such services use various Human Interaction Proof’s (HIPs) to authenticate that the user is a human and not a bot. Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA) is a class of HIPs tests and are based on Artificial Intelligence. These tests are easier for humans to qualify and tough for bots to simulate. Several Web services use CAPTCHAs as a defensive mechanism against automated Web-bots. In this paper, we review the existing CAPTCHA schemes that have been proposed or are being used to protect various Web services. We classify them in groups and compare them with each other in terms of security and usability. We present general method used to generate and break text-based and image-based CAPTCHAs. Further, we discuss various security and usability issues in CAPTCHA design and provide guidelines for improving their robustness and usability.},
