@article{Khong2004,
abstract = {In this paper, I develop an economic argument for regulating the sending of junk emails, and examine the efficiency of various approaches to regulate junk emails. The first part of the paper develops an externality model of spam to show that in the absence of regulation, junk emails are inefficient. Next, I analyse the regulatory approaches presently used in the United States in three categories: opt-out, filtering and blocking, and opt-in. The study finds that spam can be both a positive externality as well as a negative o足ne. However, the likelihood of being a negative externality is more probable. Absence regulation, no allocation of a property right to spam leads to an efficient level of spam. An examination of the three categories show that o足nly the opt-in approach ensures that there is no net social loss, but not necessarily at a socially efficient level of spam. Hence, it is o足nly a second best solution. Based o足n the conclusions that opt-in is the best solution given the constraints of transaction cost, the paper suggests a set of policy conclusions that serve as guidelines for countries enacting laws to regulate junk emails or spam.},

@techreport{Egen2009,
abstract = {CAPTCHAs are commonly used security measures on the internet that prevent automated programs from abusing online services. They do so by asking humans to perform a task that computers cannot yet perform, such as recognizing shapes, deciphering distorted characters, discerning objects or animals in images or solving puzzles. CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart. As we will see, many attacks have been attempted to break or beat CAPTCHAS with some success. We will look at these unique, creative and even resourceful attempts and subsequent countermeasures and propose a new system of our own, building on some recent successes},
